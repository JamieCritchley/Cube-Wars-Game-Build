# Cube-Wars-Game-Build
A top-down shooting game made for my "Games Development" 1st year module.

All coding and design is my own. 
No non-primitive textures or 3D model assets are used, as the assessment brief did not allow them.
All music and sound effects are not mine, and are credited in-game.

As this was the first game I made, I did not consider adding the control scheme, so I've provided
it here:

WASD to move, mouse to rotate and left click to fire. Q switches between 2 characters: 1 character 
is smaller and quicker, but takes more damage from enemies and deals less damage through bullets.
